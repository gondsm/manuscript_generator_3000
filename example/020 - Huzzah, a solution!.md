"The key issue," the engineer thought, "is that of simple concatenation. All I need to do is cat a few files together and kablamo, I can read the entire manuscript!"

In a flurry of ugly code, the engineer wrote some python that would concatenate files according to some index, spitting out a massive markdown file. The engineer then started reading it and realised -- with some dismay -- that as useful as that file was, there was no way to annotate it!

"Damn and blast!" said the engineer, furious. "So much wasted effort in building a pointless script!"

But many years ago the engineer found someone, and that someone has -- for some reason -- decided to share her life with the engineer. As the engineer's fury raged across his eyes, she looked up from her iPad and asked

"What the hell are you even talking about?"

And that was it! Eureka! If the manuscript found itself on an iPad, surely the engineer could pencil in some notes!
