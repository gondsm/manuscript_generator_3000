Once upon a time, a software engineer had a problem. You see, the engineer fancied himself a writer -- for some reason -- but the engineer also fancied himself other things, such as a fan of open source, as well as of simplistic structures.

"A problem for the future," the engineer thought. "As long as I stick to plain text files, I should be absolutely fine in the future. What could go wrong?"

And so the engineer wrote. Short stories, novellas, novels, essays, random thoughts, you name it, he wrote them, until he ended up with gigantic directories full of markdown files which, whilst neatly filed by date, topic, manuscript, etc, were no closer to ever being something cohesive.

All this time, the engineer edited his work by reading markdown files. "It's as good as reading something else," the engineer thought, foolishly.

Until one day the engineer was working on something very long, and about thirty files in realised, with some dismay, how nice it would be to be able to read all of that in a single file.

And so a problem is found.
