And thus an idea is born. If the engineer could code up a tool that imported the manuscript into an intermediate format, then he could write exporters into whatever technologies he needed!

He drew up his requirements. He had to keep the plain text files, of course, as plain text is the ultimate representation. The tool had to happily tie into his existing system for organising files, his so-called index files. The tool had to be extensible to support various exporters, with PDF being the highest priority.

And, of course, the whole thing had to be open source!

"What do I call it, though?" the engineer thought.

Well there was a time somewhere in the 90s where everything was either "Turbo" or "2000". 2000 is long gone, of course, but what's next?

The Manuscript Generator 3000!
